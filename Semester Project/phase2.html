                <p>
                    Getting back into the community is challenging in itself but being unprepared to face it’s challenges is a formula for failure. You’ll probably read this statement over and over because it’ll happen over and over, you will have opportunities denied and
                    taken from you so don’t be surprised and don’t lose hope because you have the power to change things. Remember you’re going back to a community, a family, a society, and a culture that has not changed that much and expects for you
                    to almost be the same person you were before you were incarcerated. It’s hard to come home to so many expectations and the pressure of being that provider, go-getter, hustler, and ruler of your domain. Family such as children and significant
                    others can put a lot of pressure on you to immediately jump into action but you can’t, I repeat you can’t.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Directives:</h4>
                <p>
                    In this phase your duty is to establish yourself and create a path that will lead to stability. Focusing on your family, friends, or social circle and worrying about helping or supporting them is a big mistake. You’re probably questioning my logic right
                    now but let me say or ask this much, did they have your help a few weeks or months ago and did they survive. You should be thinking of stability for yourself to be the man or woman of strength to then be able to support or help those
                    within your circle but if you run yourself thin now, before you’re stable, everyone will just fall. The following should be solidified prior to leaving the halfway house or prior to helping with the bills, make sure that the following
                    are established for yourself.

                    For many the halfway house will help to provide most of the above but I will tell you that it’s not guaranteed and I would do your best to obtain these things on your own. Please see the tabs for programs that will provide them or help you find them.
