                    A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Your first steps are critical and will ensure your success. The first 5 things you need to focus on are: preparing for your halfway house, getting identification, obtaining state assistance, finding
                    program resources, and finally getting grounded.

                <h4>Narrative:</h4>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, my experience with the halfway house was not a good one. I received no assistance from them and to top it off, felt pressure every day to find work and when I did I was shocked, no pissed, at the fact that they were taking 25% of my check. Mind you, my first job was at a Subway so I wasn’t making much, so saving money was almost impossible because I had to purchase my own clothes and hygienic items. I honestly thought things would be better at the halfway house and that was my mistake. I made the mistake of thinking I had freedom and could do more things but in truth it was just like being on lock down with a work furlough.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Directives:</h4>
                <p> 
                    Every halfway house is different but they also have a few things in common that you should know and understand. First and foremost, the Department of Corrections is paying the halfway house for your bed. Based on their specific agreement with the DOC the halfway house is obligated to provide you with basic services such as shelter and food. Some provide additional services such as job search and guidance. Please contact your institution counselor or case manager to request a copy of the halfway houses manual, a copy of a visiting list to mail to your family, and the number of your parole officer.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Section Goals:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get halfway house manual</li>
                    <li>Get copy of visiting list</li>
                    <li>Get Parole officer contact information</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>
                    The halfway house manual will give you an idea of what type of assistance to expect and will allow you to get to know their policies and procedures. For example, some halfway houses will not allow you to leave the house until three business days have passed; you have attended an orientation, and have obtained your I.D. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Do not count on the halfway house staff to initiate, organize, or complete anything for you. Understand that they are officially obligated to assist you but most of the time they are just there to watch you. You must stay on top of things yourself and make sure that they not only provide you with what it is written in their manual but assist you with your goals. Getting your parole officers contact information is vital for this very reason because if they do not assist you it is up to you to call the parole officer and request a transfer or his/her assistance to accomplish what the halfway house cannot or will not.
                </p><br>
                <h4>The following is an itemized list of things you may need for the halfway house:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Toothpaste/toothbrush</li>
                    <li>Soap</li>
                    <li>Underwear</li>
                    <li>T-shirts</li>
                    <li>Sweat suits or shorts</li>
                    <li>Sneakers</li>
                    <li>TV& CD player</li>
                    <li>Business Suit</li>

                <h2 id="identification">Identification</h2><hr><br>
                <h4>Narrative:</h4>
                <p>
                    The first time I went to DMV after coming home (yes first time) I was pumped and excited. I THOUGHT I had all the required documents but the two proofs of address that I had with me were not valid. They needed two official letters from either some type of company such as a utility bill or a credit card company. I did not have either. I was forced to wait until my probation officer sent me a letter through the mail and I had my attorney send me one as well in order for them to accept them. It took an additional two weeks for me to get those letters and I lost a job opportunity in the process because I didn’t have my I.D.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Directives:</h4>
                <p>
                    It is vital that you obtain your identification as soon as possible if you do not possess one already. Identification is the key to all other resources, services, and employment. The following is a list of required documents to obtain your ID, the locations where you can obtain those documents and the agencies that will assist you with obtaining them. Please do not hesitate to obtain your I.D. The error many make is deciding to wait until they apply for their actual license or reinstate their license with the justification of accomplishing two goals with one transaction but statistically this does not happen. If you go to a halfway house you will receive assistance completing this process but I would do my best to retrieve all the required documents even prior to release, if possible. Remember identification in these modern times is more than just a card. You will also need to set up an email and Linkedin page. I would also save you state or federal inmate I.D.

                </ul><br>
                <h4>Birth Certificate</h4>
                <p>
                    The City’s Department of Vital Records issues birth certificates. The fee for a birth certificate is $20 for a large copy or $15 for a wallet size copy. Birth certificates are confidential and only available to certain individuals, as follows:
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    (1) a person whose name appears on the certificate (mother, father, or person themselves),
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) a grandparent with the proper proof of relationship (if you are a paternal grandparent your son’s name must be on the certificate in order to obtain a copy) and
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3) a court appointed guardian or a person granted power of attorney provided a copy of the appointment papers are submitted.
                </p><br>

                <h4>Social Security Card</h4>
                <p>An application must be obtained and filled out and submitted in person by you or a family member.

                    If you are looking at this section I hope you are not too proud to actually utilize these resources. We are actually blessed to still be able to utilize these services even after breaking state laws. Please take advantage of these services until you reestablish
                    yourself. Let me repeat that, until you establish yourself. These services should not be used as a crutch but as a cast at the minimum. The average, unmotivated individual not only takes advantage but then gets lazy and becomes codependent
                    to these services and makes it a lifestyle instead of a boost to have a better lifestyle.

                    Failing a drug or alcohol test is the number-one reason parolees are sent back to jail or prison. That’s why no 
                    reentry program is complete without addressing the issue of drug and alcohol addictions.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    According to the Center for Alcohol and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University (www.casacolumbia.org), 
                    80 percent of inmates were involved with drugs or alcohol before entering prison – and a majority of these were 
                    drunk or high when they committed their crimes.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Many ex-prisoners think they have conquered their addictions because of the months/years they have been sober 
                    while in prison. But it’s pretty easy to stay sober when you’re locked up and have no access to drugs or 
                    alcohol. The real test of sobriety begins the moment the ex-prisoner walks back into the free world where bars 
                    and drug dealers are as near as the next street corner.
