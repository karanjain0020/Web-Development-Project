                    If you’re reading this section it means one or two things, you’re scrolling through just to see what the
                    future holds or you have made it this far and are ready. If you’re ready congratulations and welcome to
                    the elite few. I’m sorry to say this but only about 20% of us make it this far but I’m hoping this website
                    has somehow changed that. Now that you are an established citizen, a responsible adult, and a
                    accomplished professional it is time for you to complete the cycle of restoration. It’s time to give back to
                    the community you once helped to destroy with your lawlessness. Look to volunteer in whatever area of
                    service you created chaos in. For example, I sold drugs so when I finally had my awakening I realized that
                    what I was doing was helping people remain addicted to drugs which ruined their lives and the lives of
                    their families. I volunteered at N.A. meetings to help people stay sober and did my best to ensure their
                    lives got better in whatever way possible. When I volunteered I realized that even though we never put
                    a gun to someone’s head, our motivation whether it may be through drugs, assault, robbery, or
                    intimidation effected their lives a lot. Even our absence, when we got ourselves incarcerated, effected
                    those around us causing a trickle effect that hurt all those around us. From leaving children to struggle
                    on their own with a single parent to entire families that depended on our strength to carry them
                    through. Now is the time, in your new stability, to create good trickles around you.
